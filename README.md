Project summary:

In today's digitized world, users increasingly desire to perform their regular tasks from anywhere and acquire knowledge with ease. With the proliferation of smart devices, the expectation is for every product to be remotely manageable and for users to stay informed about the current status of their products. Many manufacturers continue to invest in smart products for the future, and users, attracted by the advantages of savings and convenience, gravitate towards technology-driven products. In order to maintain their position in the market, manufacturers must invest in smart product technologies.

This project aims to enable users to effectively utilize internet-connected smart refrigerators [i.e., Internet of Things (IoT) devices]. The goal is for users to save time while keeping up with today's and tomorrow's technological advancements.

The proposed project will function as follows: A Raspberry Pi system with Wi-Fi connectivity will be placed inside the refrigerator, and a camera will be connected to this system. The Raspberry Pi camera system will capture images of the refrigerator's contents. Through object recognition models, these images will identify the types of products that is present. Alongside this information, the image itself will be transmitted to a cloud-based Firebase system. The transferred data will then be relayed from the cloud environment to a mobile application, which will be developed. The quantity of the obtained products will be conveyed to the user. The planned data transfer frequency is once per minute. Within the application, the user will be able to access information such as the last time the refrigerator's contents changed, the products that entered or exited the refrigerator from the time they last used the application until now, and how the contents of the refrigerator appeared in the last minute.

Keywords: Smart refrigerator, IoT device, mobile application, saving, Cloud, image processing, object detection.
