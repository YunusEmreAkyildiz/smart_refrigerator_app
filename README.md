Project summary:

In today's digitalized world, users want to be able to do their regular work in the easiest way and to have information regardless of where they are. With the increasing number of smart products, the expectation is developing in the way of managing each product remotely and to be aware of the current status of the products. Many manufacturers continue to invest in smart products for the future, and while users turn to products that follow the technology trend due to the savings and convenience advantages they provide, manufacturers have to invest in smart product technologies if they want to maintain their place in the market.

This project aims to make users to effectively use their smart refrigerators [that is, Internet of Things (IoT) devices] with internet connection. It is envisaged that users will save time while keeping up with the technological developments of today and the future.

How the project will work is as follows; A Raspberry Pi system with a Wi-Fi connection will be placed in the refrigerator, and a camera and a sensor will be connected to this system. This camera and sensor will transfer the temperature information of the refrigerator and the image information of the interior of the refrigerator to the cloud over internet connections. This information will be transferred from the cloud environment to the mobile application to be written, and object identification algorithms will be used on the image information received on the mobile application and the quantities of the products in the refrigerator will be controlled. The temperature and quantity information of the products obtained as a result of the processes will be transmitted to the user. The planned data transfer period is to be done once a day, but the user will be able to take and view the snapshot of the refrigerator via the application whenever he/she wants.

Keywords: Smart refrigerator, IoT device, mobile application, saving, Cloud, image processing, object detection.
